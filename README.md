# Second chapter from Rocketseat

It's an app to manage incomes/outcomes.

----------- img space --------------

Every style in this app is made with styled components and polished.

## Issues

Actually this app request data from a fake API, but some information still static.

Need to work on:

- [x] Modal to add new values.
- [ ] Send those values to our fake API.(MirageJs)
- [ ] Configure useContext.
- [ ] turn summary into dinamic information.
- [ ] List and delete any income/outcome.
