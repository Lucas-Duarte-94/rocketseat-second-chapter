Every style in this app is made with styled components and polished.

## Issues

Actually this app request data from a fake API, but some information still static.

Need to work on:

- [x] Modal to add new values.
- [x] Send those values to our fake API.(MirageJs)
- [x] Configure useContext.
- [x] turn summary into dinamic information.
- [x] Listing new transactions.
- [ ] Deleting transactions.
